# PHP5-CallManager-AXL
PHP5 Implementation to interface with Cisco unified call manager (CUCM) over the administrative XML (AXL) implememtation.
This library requires a copy of the CORRECT .WSDL file for YOUR VERSION of callmanager.
Since Cisco doesnt seem to publish the WSDL at a standard location on CUCM for remote inclusion, you must have a local copy.
This library is under development so should be considered unstable and subject to major changes.
Ping me with questions if you are extremely interested in using it, I plan to use it in an existing provisioning system.
